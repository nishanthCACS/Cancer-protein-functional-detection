V_91 Tier_1 and TIer_2 genes classification by models build on 10_fold(V84_BIR using Before_thresh SITE must data)
These results were created by fully clean PDBs(thus these dosen't have overlapping PDBS at all)

sicne the overlapping PDBs through the model hasn't run yet
The genes set have overlapping PDBs is in Tier-1 'ONGO_TSG' class is left
And the problemetric genes those genes(belongs Tier-1 to ONGO and TSG have more than 50% overlapping PDBs) were not evaluated yet
