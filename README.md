# Cancer protein functional detection

A combined deep learning model to predict tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and fusion from 3D (PDB) structures with their biochemical properties.

Part of the work is published in the Journal Computers in Biology and Medicine (Elsevier). This Cancer_protein_functional_detection code is mainly uploaded for a better understanding of my dissertation document.

Part of my dissertation document related to this project is given in the report. ("Level_2_report.pdf")
