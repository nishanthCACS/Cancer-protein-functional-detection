# Cancer_protein_functional_detection
A Deep Learning combined Model for Predicting Tumor Suppressor Genes, Oncogenes and Fusion from PDB Structures

Since this is my dessertation work all coding is done by myself under the supervision of Dr. Chu and Dr. Logan. 
Part of the work is published on the Journal Computers in Biology and Medicine (Elsevier). ThisCancer_protein_functional_detection code is mainly uploaded for the better understanding of my desseration document.
